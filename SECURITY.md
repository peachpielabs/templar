# Security

We welcome feedback from security researchers and the general public
to help improve our security. If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability,
privacy issue, exposed data, or other security issues in any of our assets, we
want to hear from you. This policy outlines steps for reporting vulnerabilities
to us, what we expect, what you can expect from us.

# Where should I report security issues?
Please report security issues to security@peachpielabs.com, providing all relevant information. The more details you provide, the easier it will be for us to triage and fix the issue.

# Our Commitments

When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and validate your report;
- Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is processed;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within our operational constraints; and
- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy.

# Our Expectations

In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant agreements.
  If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other applicable terms, the
  terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or
  harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time (at least 90 days from the initial report) to
  resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which
  are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you
  access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and
  cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing,
  such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI),
  credit card data, or proprietary information;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from
- the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.
